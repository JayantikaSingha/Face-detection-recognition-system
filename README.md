# Face-detection-recognition-system
The sophisticated face detection and recognition system designed for real-time applications. Initially, it employs a pre-trained face detection model based on the Caffe framework's Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) architecture, which excels in identifying faces within images by analyzing their spatial and visual features.
